# WebGl
This repository contains multiple files that contains codes and programs which are exercises from a course called computer graphic, which is in the my third semester of my studies. 
In this course we learned about shaders, how to create 3D shapes, how to read big mesh data, and how to set a camera, all using JavaScript and WebGl.

The first Exercise of the course is in a repository called animation-canvas. the rest of the exercises are all in this repository.
The second Exercise is about creating basic shapes and animations that either randomly moves or moves accourding to the Frequency data of a song. using WebGl, by creating the fragment and the Vertex shader.
third Exercise is about reading mesh Data from JSON files. we learn to read through big binary data, and how to splitt the buffer. we created a nice 3D model, and learned how to let it move.
fourth Exercise is about reading Mesh Data and applying textures
Fifth Exercise is about Transformation, reading and understanding how to access the data in scenes, and iterating them in order to get a specific transformation and animation.
last Exercise is about lighting and camera position.

ps: fourth and sixth exercises are incomplete, but im posting them in gitHub for further improvements in the future.
